# IoBe_Dataset
In the data collection step, the behavior of a normal internet user was made on the computer. In order to reflect the internet traffic of the users, 20 different internet applications were used and the recommended IoBe data set was created. Each of the applications was run individually and in the meantime application traffic was captured with Wireshark. The obtained wireshark capture files are parsed into their features with the CICFlowmeter tool, a network analyzer software. CICFlowmeter is written in java language and generates Biflows from network traffic online or from offline pcap files. Thus, it extracts features from network streams. The application parses the network traffic into 80 features and converts these outputs to CSV format. This software is mostly produced to detect attacks on the network. But in this study, it was used for the behavior analysis of the internet user. For “Forum” category, most-used forums in Turkey were discussed. “Memurlar” forum is visited by many users as it is a forum where many postings are posted. Also, “EksiSozluk” forum is a forum page where many users comment on various topics.
